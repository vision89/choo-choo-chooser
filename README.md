## Choo Choo Chooser!

This is an offline-first train chooser app for my second udacity project.  I'm using material design lite, and polymer to create it.

[Demo](COMING SOON!)

# To install

Run 'npm install' and 'bower install'

# To Build

You can run 'gulp' to run all of the development build routines.  This will also generate documentation.  It will automatically serve the choo choo chooser app and the docs.

You can run 'gulp dist' to build the distro, and gulp 'serve-dist' to serve te distro

# Structure

Files for active development are in the /app directory.
The files in /app are built/transpiled and put into the /dev directory to serve during development.
The files in /app are built/transpiled/minified and put into the /dist directory to create a releasable distro.
